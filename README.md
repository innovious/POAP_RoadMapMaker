# POAP_RoadMapMaker
Automate the creation of a plan-on-a-page (POAP) style roadmap using Microsoft Office 365 online tools. Easy integration with SharePoint lists, MS Planner, ADO, using PowerAutomate and OFficeScipt. It was developed in OfficeScript using the online Typescript version provided by Microsoft.   
Based on many years working as test architetect in international SAP projects over the last 20 year, we found that a simple project 'plan-on-a-page' style plan is all that's required to communicate and run large international projects. I've seen many experienced project managers who have tried and failed to present and communicate complex MS-Project plans to the project teams before, but these are generally far too detailed, complex and 'dry' for all project team members to understand; taking into account that many team members are superusers, who are not technical or trained in project managmeent principles. The POAP RoadMapMaker is a high-level, and simple plan that all project resources can understand. It fits on one powerpoint slide, so it's easy to add to the stand-up meetings and to communicate the latest updates, milestones and any dependencies arcoss workstreams easily.
