# POAP_RoadMapMaker
Automate the creation of a plan-on-a-page style roadmap.  
Based on many years working in SAP roll-out projects over the last 20 year, we found that a simple project plan-on-a-page style plan is all that's required to communicate and run large international project. Many project managers have treid and failed to present and communicate complex MS-Project plans to the project teams as it's far too detailed and complex to understand. POAP RoadMapMaker is a high-level, and simple plan that all project resources an understand. It fits on one powerpoint slide, so it's easy to add the roadmap to powerpoint presentation and to communicate the updated milestones and dependencies arcoss workstreams easily.
