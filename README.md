# POAP_RoadMapMaker
This app uses Officescript (using TypeScript) to automate the creation of a plan-on-a-page (POAP) style roadmap, using Microsoft Office 365 online version of Excel. The benefit's with the online version is that it has easier integration to other MS Office tools, such as SharePoint lists, MS Planner, ADO, using PowerAutomate, PowrApps and OFficeScipt. It was developed in OfficeScript (Typescript) using the standard version of Microsoft online. <br>  
Based on over 10 years years working as test manager and test architetect in international SAP projects, I found that a simple project 'plan-on-a-page' style plan is all that's actually required to communicate and run large international projects. It's easy to to update manuallly or automatically using VBA or PowerAutomate or office script so a real-time 'dynamic' version or daily version can easily be created for stand-up meetings. I've seen many experienced project managers, struggeling and failing trying to use MS project planner to present and communicate complex MS-Project plans to the project teams before, but these are generally far too detailed, too complex to keep update a nd automate and is a rather 'dry' topic for all other project team members to understand. This is especially true when most of the team members are superusers during a User Acceptance Test, as these people are who are not technical or trained in project managmeent principles. <br>

The POAP RoadMapMaker is a high-level, and simple plan that all project resources can understand. It fits on one powerpoint slide, so it's easy to add to the stand-up meetings and to communicate the latest updates, milestones and any dependencies arcoss workstreams easily. <br>

The Wiki explains the details of the (type)script used to create the 'canvas' of the roadmap and the intergration between PowerAps and PowerAutomate to trigger the script. Another typescript takes data from a sharepoint list that populates the plan with test phases, milestones and dependencies.
