Automate the creation of a plan-on-a-page style roadmap 
Based on amny years working in SAP roll-out project, I have found that a simple project plan-on-a-page is all that's required to communicate and run large international project. It's high-level, and simple to understand by all project resources. It also fits on one powerpoint slide so it's easy to add the plan to stand-up meeting presentations.
